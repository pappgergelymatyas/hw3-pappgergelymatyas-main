Before working on this assignment, check out the section on lists in this [tutorial](https://github.com/Rajk-Prog1/prog1-teaching-materials/blob/main/tutorials/python_basic/basics.ipynb).

# Task

There is an integer, **n**. For all non-negative integers **i** < **n**, return **$i^2$** .

# Example

**n** = 3

The list of non-negative integers that are less than **n** is [0, 1, 2]. Return a list containing the square of each number.

    [0, 1, 4]

# Input Format

The integer, **n**.

# Constraints

1 <= **n** <= 20


# Output Format

A list containing the square of each **$i^2$**.

# Sample Input 0

    5
# Sample Output 0

    [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
